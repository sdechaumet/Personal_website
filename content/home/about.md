# Biography

I finished my PhD in metabolomic at the Institute of Genetic, Environment and Plant Protection ([IGEPP](http://www6.rennes.inra.fr/igepp)). My work aimed to have a better understanding of plants metabolism during ageing. Using metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches, I'm developing bioinformatics tools to assess & interpret the analysis of omics data using [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Beside my work at the Institute, I'm also a board member of the Junior section of the [RFMF](http://www.rfmf.fr/rfmf-junior.html) where we work on networking, teaching and organising the metabolomic and fluxomic community.

My personal projects are mostly driven by open-access on subjects as data analysis & visualisations, web scrapping, domotic development (electronic & informatics) and mechanics.
